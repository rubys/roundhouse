# CRuby-only Rails::Application#routes surface.
#
# Lobsters' config/application.rb composes absolute URLs via
# `Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.root_url(host:, protocol:)`
# (Story#short_id_url and friends). The shared runtime's Application is
# deliberately empty (NameError over silent stubs); this overlay adds
# the real thing for CRuby: url_helpers resolves against the emitted
# RouteHelpers, and root_url composes protocol://host + root_path.
# Overlay, not shared runtime — the kwarg signature is exactly the
# forwarding shape strict targets refuse (see the kwarg-forwarding gap).
