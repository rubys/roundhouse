# target tables (the scaffold dir-walk ships it to spinel/CRuby/JRuby
# only). These bodies exercise emitter surface the elixir/rust lanes
# don't carry yet (String#include? renders .__struct__ on elixir;
# while-loops with post-loop reads hit the functionalize sign-threading
# gap) — they join the universal file when those lanes' emitters catch
# up and lobsters reaches them.
