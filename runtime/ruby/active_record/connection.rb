# Raw-SQL surface of `Model.connection` / `ActiveRecord::Base.connection`.
#
# Rails hands back the adapter itself here; this runtime hands back a
# thin stateless facade over the per-target `Db` primitive shim — just
# the members the corpus reaches for when it drops below the Relation
# layer (lobsters' Keystore upserts, hand-written aggregate queries,
# `quote`/`quote_string` in SQL-building helpers). Statically
# resolvable by construction: fixed methods, no method_missing.
#
# Result rows are `Hash[String, untyped]` — raw SQL is the one place
# the row shape is genuinely dynamic (aliased aggregates, computed
# columns), so a typed bag is the honest contract rather than an
# avoidable erasure.
module ActiveRecord
